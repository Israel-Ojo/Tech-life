Hi and Welcome!
This is a project by Israel. It’s called My Tech Life — a space where I share what I’m learning about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Through this project, I want to teach, create, and grow as a web developer. You’ll find my lessons, projects, and ideas as I continue learning and improving in front-end development.
